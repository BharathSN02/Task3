Data Visualization 

The KPI cards provide a high-level overview of the sales performance. They instantly show how much revenue was generated, how many vehicles were sold, the average price per vehicle, profit margins (price vs. market value).

Line chart helps identify sales patterns over time. It reveals seasonal peaks, demand trends, and periods of high or low sales activity. Any consistent growth or sudden drops in sales can be quickly spotted, helping decision-makers understand market cycles.

Bar chart highlights the most popular vehicle brand and models based on the number of units sold. It provides insights into consumer preferences and market demand. These top performers can be key targets for future marketing or inventory planning.

The map visual shows geographical sales distribution. It identifies which states or regions contribute most to sales and where business is underperforming. This can guide regional sales strategies and dealer expansion plans.

Scatter Plot demonstrates the relationship between vehicle mileage and selling price. It typically shows that as odometer readings increase, selling prices drop. It also helps visualize outliers — high-priced, high-mileage vehicles or low-priced, low-mileage ones that might require further analysis.

Clustered Column Chart shows which vehicle body types are sold above or below their market value. Positive deviations indicate profitable segments, while negative deviations may suggest over-discounting or poor market alignment. It helps optimize pricing strategies for different vehicle types.

Pie chart illustrates the condition mix of the vehicles sold. It shows the proportion of excellent, good, fair, or poor-condition vehicles. This helps understand the overall quality of the sales inventory and may indicate customer focus areas — whether buyers are more interested in new-like vehicles or are purchasing based on price regardless of condition.
